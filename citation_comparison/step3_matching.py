**Implement one-to-one matching, caliper without replacement**

Variants of the method are examined in the following paper. This is something to explore further. </br> Austin, P. C. (2014), A comparison of 12 algorithms for matching on the propensity score. Statist. Med., 33: 1057â€“1069. doi: 10.1002/sim.6004

The following "Match" function is from "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kellieotto/StatMoments/blob/master/PSM.ipynb"

def Match(groups, propensity, caliper = 0.05):
    ''' 
    Inputs:
    groups = Treatment assignments.  Must be 2 groups
    propensity = Propensity scores for each observation. Propensity and groups should be in the same order (matching indices)
    caliper = Maximum difference in matched propensity scores. For now, this is a caliper on the raw
            propensity; Austin reccommends using a caliper on the logit propensity.
    
    Output:
    A series containing the individuals in the control group matched to the treatment group.
    Note that with caliper matching, not every treated individual may have a match.
